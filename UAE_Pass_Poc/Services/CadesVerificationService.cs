            // The key challenge is how CAdES handles the signed content when it's a detached hash.

            try
            {

                //SignedCms signedCms = new SignedCms();
                //signedCms.Decode(signatureBytes);

                // 3. Verify the signature
                // This step typically involves verifying against a certificate chain and the content.
                // For CAdES, the signed content is often embedded or referenced.
                // If the signature is on a *hash* of the payload, you'd need to ensure the CAdES
                // verification process supports verifying a detached signature on a hash.

                // The `CheckSignature` method verifies the cryptographic signature and the certificate chain.
                // In a real scenario, you'd provide a list of trusted certificates (e.g., UAEPASS root CA).
                // For simplicity, this example uses `false` for checkCertificate, but you MUST use `true`
                // and provide trusted certificates in a production environment.
                //signedCms.CheckSignature(false); // Set to 'true' and provide trusted certificates in production

                // 4. Verify the signed content (the hash)
                // This is the trickiest part for detached signatures on a hash.
                // The `SignedCms` object might contain the hash of the original content,
                // or you might need to extract it from the signed attributes.
                // Appendix-VI will be crucial here.

                // Placeholder for hash comparison - actual implementation depends on CAdES structure
                // If the CAdES signature includes the hash as a signed attribute, you'd extract it and compare.
                // For now, we'll assume the `CheckSignature` implicitly validates the content if it's embedded.
                // If it's a detached signature on a hash, you might need to manually compare.
